# BA-Project
This is a group project carried out by a team of four.
The tools used for this project are Bizagi, X-mind and Pencil.
This project helped me discover the importance of working in teams.
A blockchain company known as FOTHPAY was the company in view where analysis was carried out. 
A Business Model Canvas was designed for the company.
Then my team went on to develop a Business Modelling Process using Bizagi.
We tried to take an overview of the problems encountered by FOTHPAY in her operations and we proffered solutions to them. The team used X-mind for mind mapping.
On a last note we developed a proto-type for the business using Pencil.
